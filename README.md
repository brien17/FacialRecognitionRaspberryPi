# PersonalProject
This repository is for a personal project completed for my COP 2001 Programing methodology course. The goal of this project was to build a system that could run on the raspberry pi that could detect and recognize faces from a live video feed. More information about the project can be found in the problem statement file in this repository.

This project was made with help from this tutorial: https://www.hackster.io/mjrobot/real-time-face-recognition-an-end-to-end-project-a10826. 

# Timelog
## Week 1:
### 4 hours
### Accomplished
Installed rapbian on a micro sd

Updated the default python install on the pi

Created a virtual environment for python

Installed numpy on the pi

Downloaded and compiled opencv

### Learned
How to set up a new pi

How to create a python virtual environment on the pi

How to compile software on the pi

## Week 2:
### 5 hours
### Accomplished
Set up pi camera to work with open cv

Got open cv to be able to stream video from the pi camera

Configured open cv to be able to detect faces in the live video feed

Got open cv draw boxes in the video feed over where it found faces in real time

### Learned
How to configure open cv with a camera

How to use pretrained models in open cv to perform complex tasks

How to train new open cv models

How to make open cv draw things in the video feed

## Week 3:
### 3 hours
### Accomplished
Got open cv to be able to collect a data sample from the faces it sees in the video feed and save them as images

Trained a model based on the images collected by open cv

Ran the trained model and used it to recognize faces in the video feed

### Learned
How to use open cv to collect data about specific things when they are detected in the video feed

How to train a model on open cv to be able to detect specific things in the video feed

How to run a trained model for detection with a video feed
